 <summary><h4>👩🏽‍💻 Miraya's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I'm Miraya, a 20-year-old self-taught frontend developer. I discovered my passion for coding when I saw my brother doing it in 2020. I fell in love with using my creativity to build things for the web.

I decided to drop out of high school and pursue a coding career, facing challenges along the way. Through persistence, self-discipline, and staying committed, I achieved my goal of becoming a frontend developer.

Currently, I'm working as a frontend developer. I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a software engineer, and I'm constantly amazed by how powerful software is in helping us achieve great things.

I'm currently learning mobile development with React Native. You can follow my journey on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mirayatech/).
