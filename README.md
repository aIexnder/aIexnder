 <summary><h4>👩🏽‍💻 Miraya's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I'm Miraya, a 20 year old self-taught frontend developer. I discovered my passion for coding when I saw my brother doing it in 2019. I fell in love with using my creativity to build things for the web.

I decided to drop out of high school and pursue a coding career, facing challenges along the way. Through persistence, self-discipline, and staying committed, I achieved my goal of becoming a frontend developer.

Currently, I'm working as a frontend developer. I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a software engineer, and I'm constantly amazed by how powerful software is in helping us achieve great things.
